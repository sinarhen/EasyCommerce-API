## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

To install and run the project, you have two options:
1. **Using Docker Compose**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This will build the Docker images and start the services, including the PostgreSQL container.

2. **Locally without Docker**
Before building the project, you might want to run
```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```
Change the `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` in the `appsettings.Development.json` file to point to your local PostgreSQL database.

</details>

## üöÄ Usage
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

To use the EasyCommerce-API, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Application**: If you're using Docker, run `docker-compose up --build` in the terminal from the root directory of the project. If you're running the project locally, use `dotnet run` from the terminal or start the project from your IDE.

2. **Access the API**: The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`. You can use tools like Postman or curl to send HTTP requests to the API.

3. **API Endpoints**: Refer to the [API Endpoints](#-api-endpoints) section for details on the available endpoints and their functionality.

4. **Authentication**: Some endpoints may require authentication. Refer to the [Authentication and Authorization](#-authentication-and-authorization) section for details on how to authenticate.

Remember to replace the `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` in the `appsettings.Development.json` file with your local PostgreSQL database connection string if you're running the project locally.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

In the EasyCommerce-API project, error handling is managed through a middleware called `ExceptionMiddleware`. This middleware is a custom piece of software that is inserted into the HTTP request/response pipeline. It catches any exceptions that occur during the execution of the application and handles them appropriately.

The `ExceptionMiddleware` is defined in the `ExceptionMiddleware.cs` file. It has a constructor that takes a `RequestDelegate` as a parameter. This delegate represents the next middleware in the pipeline.

The `InvokeAsync` method is where the middleware's logic is implemented. It awaits the execution of the next middleware in the pipeline inside a try-catch block. If an exception is thrown during the execution of the next middleware, it is caught and passed to the `HandleExceptionAsync` method.

The `HandleExceptionAsync` method is responsible for handling the exception. It sets the response's content type to "application/json" and determines the status code based on the type of the exception. If the exception is an `UnauthorizedAccessException`, the status code is set to 401 (Unauthorized). If the exception is an `ArgumentException`, the status code is set to 400 (Bad Request). For all other exceptions, the status code is set to 500 (Internal Server Error).
**Note** Reason of this is main operations made with repositories and to translate the exception to a meaningful message for the client, it is necessary to catch the exception and handle it.
But actually throwing an error is not a cheap operation, so it is better to avoid throwing exceptions. Maybe in the future, it is better to use a different approach to handle errors.

Finally, the method writes an `ErrorDetails` object to the response. This object includes the status code and the message of the exception.

Here is a high-level overview of how the `ExceptionMiddleware` works:

1. An HTTP request comes into the application.
2. The request passes through the middleware pipeline, reaching the `ExceptionMiddleware`.
3. If no exceptions are thrown during the processing of the request, the `ExceptionMiddleware` simply passes the request along to the next piece of middleware.
4. If an exception is thrown, the `ExceptionMiddleware` catches it.
5. The `ExceptionMiddleware` processes the exception, which can involve logging it, wrapping it, or suppressing it.
6. The `ExceptionMiddleware` returns an HTTP response that reflects the outcome of the exception processing.

Please refer to the `ExceptionMiddleware.cs` file for the specific implementation details of the `ExceptionMiddleware`.
