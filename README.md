To install and run the project, you have two options:
1. **Using Docker Compose**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This will build the Docker images and start the services, including the PostgreSQL container.

2. **Locally without Docker**
Before building the project, you might want to run
```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```
Change the `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` in the `appsettings.Development.json` file to point to your local PostgreSQL database.

<summary>Click to expand</summary>

To use the EasyCommerce-API, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Application**: If you're using Docker, run `docker-compose up --build` in the terminal from the root directory of the project. If you're running the project locally, use `dotnet run` from the terminal or start the project from your IDE.

2. **Access the API**: The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`. You can use tools like Postman or curl to send HTTP requests to the API.

3. **API Endpoints**: Refer to the [API Endpoints](#-api-endpoints) section for details on the available endpoints and their functionality.

4. **Authentication**: Some endpoints may require authentication. Refer to the [Authentication and Authorization](#-authentication-and-authorization) section for details on how to authenticate.

Remember to replace the `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` in the `appsettings.Development.json` file with your local PostgreSQL database connection string if you're running the project locally.
